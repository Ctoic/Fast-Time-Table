# Automated Timetable Generator

## Overview

Welcome to the Automated Timetable Generator repository! This project is designed to simplify the process of creating timetables for educational institutions by leveraging a genetic algorithm for optimization. The system also incorporates drag-and-drop functionality, clash detection, and displays information about instructors, classes, and the number of students enrolled.

## Features

1. **Genetic Algorithm:** The heart of the timetable generation process is a genetic algorithm that iteratively refines schedules based on various constraints and preferences. This allows for the creation of optimal timetables that meet the requirements of the institution.

2. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:** Users can easily modify the timetable by dragging and dropping classes, making it a user-friendly experience. This feature enhances flexibility and allows quick adjustments to accommodate changes in schedules or resource availability.

3. **Clash Detection:** The system is equipped with clash detection mechanisms to identify and highlight any scheduling conflicts. This ensures that the generated timetables adhere to constraints such as avoiding overlapping classes or instructor availability issues.

4. **Instructor Information:** The timetable displays relevant information about instructors, including their availability and assigned classes. This feature aids in better understanding the workload and availability of each instructor.

5. **Class Details:** Users can view detailed information about each class, including the number of students enrolled, class duration, and any specific requirements. This information assists in making informed decisions during timetable adjustments.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Automated Timetable Generator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-timetable.git
